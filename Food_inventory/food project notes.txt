kitchen food project:

thumbnails not totally implemented. right now just hardcoding 120x120

COMPLETE(cannot add image on insert) VALIDATION ON ALL ADMIN PAGES (add, edit etc.)
USE GENVALIDATOR 4 FOR THIS.

when in edit cyclone card price does not work correctly

inventory management system for setting food prices and uploading images. when clicked, show more details about them.

NOTES:
	
FOR ADDING A FOOD ITEM, WHEN THEY INSERT IT INTO THE DATABASE, TRACK THE ID, AND REDIRECT TO THE UPLOAD PAGE WITH
THAT ID PASSED TO IT. SIMULATING ADDING AN IMAGE ON INSERT.

CATEGORY MAINTENANCE ALMOST FINISHED.

1. only logged in verified users can look at and modify the inventory

2. have a way to upload jpgs (thumbnails) and when they select a food item, expand it and show the full image
(user side)

5 Add the ability for them to add an image when they add an item to the inventory! to do this we can have it post back to the
same script (add.php or so) and then use mysql_fetch_id or whatever to post back the same page with that new id posted in the url
after we do that, you can then update the picture name with the same decision structure we use in upload.php
